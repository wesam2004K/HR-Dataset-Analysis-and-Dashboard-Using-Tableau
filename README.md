# DEPI HR Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The DEPI HR Data Analysis project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative focused on examining various aspects of employee data from the DEPI HR datasets. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and integration of multiple datasets to derive insights about employee performance, satisfaction, and attrition.

## Tools and Technologies Used
This project leverages several tools and technologies to facilitate data analysis:

1. **Python**: The core programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for handling and analyzing structured data.

3. **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays.

4. **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

5. **Seaborn**: Built on Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

6. **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

## Key Features and Functionality
The DEPI HR Data Analysis project includes several key features:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading multiple CSV files, checking for null values, and handling duplicates.

2. **Data Transformation**: Converting categorical variables, parsing dates, and normalizing numerical data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships among variables using count plots, histograms, and pair plots to understand employee attrition and satisfaction.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing correlations among numerical features to identify significant relationships.

5. **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition and evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

6. **Data Integration**: Merging multiple datasets to create a comprehensive view of employee data for further analysis.

7. **Output Management**: Exporting cleaned and combined datasets to Excel files for external use.

## Conclusion
The DEPI HR Data Analysis project demonstrates the application of data analysis techniques to derive insights from employee datasets. By employing various visualization and analysis tools, this project provides a foundation for understanding employee dynamics within the organization. The findings can help inform HR strategies and improve employee satisfaction and retention.
